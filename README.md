# raft

WIP Implemention of Raft in for brain training.

## Raft Consensus Algorithm

[Raft](http://raftconsensus.github.io/) is a consensus algorithm that is
designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in
fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed
into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all
major pieces needed for practical systems.

## Usage

Need lein. Nothing to use yet tho!
